# You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name,
# inside square brackets:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"]


# There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:
x = thisdict.get("model")


# The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
x = thisdict.keys() # as a list


# Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.keys()

print(x) #before the change

car["color"] = "white"

print(x) #after the change


# The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.
x = thisdict.values()

# Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.values()

print(x) #before the change

car["year"] = 2020

print(x) #after the change


# Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.values()

print(x) #before the change

car["color"] = "red"

print(x) #after the change


# The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.
x = thisdict.items()


# The returned list is a view of the items of the dictionary,
# meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the items list.
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
